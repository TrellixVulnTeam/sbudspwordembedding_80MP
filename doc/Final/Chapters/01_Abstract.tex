This is the final project for the Digital Signal Processing course in Shahid Beheshti university. This project is indented to find a word embedding method in order to map the words to lower dimension spaces. In a way that the words that sound like each other, will be close. This embedding will help to resolve many ambiguities that will exist in normal speech recognition task. 
The idea is to convert each word to letter-grams that is the combination of letters in the word and finally  take the words that sound similar in real world and find an embedding that  have the sound similarity as a distance metric in the target space. This metric could be \textit{Cosine Distance} or \textit{Euclidian Distance}. 
We will be exploring this approach in this project.  In this project because of technical challenges we did not followed the step by step method that is used in the main article. In the other hand we have came up with a novel approach for embedding words into speech perception space.
