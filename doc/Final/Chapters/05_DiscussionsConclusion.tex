As mentioned before we are standing on a point that we just built end-to-end pipeline for voice word embedding. This could be the start of a research project. Following could be the next steps for the project: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use this method instead of beam search after RNN output 
\item Explore different hyper parameters on the embedding network and it's impacts: Dimension, Activation Functions, Number of Layers, \ldots
\item Explore voice analogy tasks with embedding 
\item Use a larger data set from LibriSpeech (We used the DEV dataset)
\item Properly separate the train and test datasets
\end{enumerate}
